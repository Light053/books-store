Books Store:

Project Description:

"Books Store" is a web application for purchasing books using React.js and Redux Toolkit. Users can browse the book selection, add them to the cart, and also get additional information about the authors.

Key Features:

- Redux Toolkit: The project is built using Redux Toolkit to manage the application state. Functional slices are specifically used to organize reducers and actions.

- Middleware: Middleware is applied, including thunk for asynchronous actions. Additionally, custom middleware such as logMiddleware and stringMiddleware are used for logging actions and handling string actions, respectively.

- Asynchronous Actions: An example of asynchronous action (myAction) is present, utilizing setTimeout to simulate delay and demonstrate asynchronous operations.

- Cart Updates: Functionality for adding, removing a single book, and removing all instances of a book from the cart is implemented.

- Additional Author Information: Functionality is implemented to retrieve additional information about the author of a book based on their identifier.
